    <p style="font-size: 30px; color: blue; font-family: cursive; background-color: aqua; width: fit-content;"> 
      ‘There lived a boy called Baba and his dog, 
      snoopy Baba was a very stubborn boy who caused his parents a lot of trouble. 
      Sometimes he fought and returned home with turned 
    clothes. His parents had warned him several times but he would.
           One day, he got into trouble on his way to school, 
           when he ordered his dog that went everywhere with him to bite a little boy who 
           refused to give him his bicycle. Unknown to Babu, the boy’s father was a policeman 
           who arrested him and his dog and took them to the police station. 
           When his parents heard, they came begging for his release, 
           telling the policeman how poor they were. But the policeman refused 
           until his parents not knowing what else to do, went to a money lender to
            borrow money which was used to take the boy to the hospital to treat the 
            dog bite.
